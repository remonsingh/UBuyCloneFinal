The Landing page of Ubuy website displays the Prducts, Search Engine, and Top categories of their website. Header section and Footer section are almost same across all the pages. In navbar we have given the hover effect to display sub categories of main category. We have made carousals, search engine using Javascript.
The main challenge was to build the site without using any library, so we took this very seriously and made all the animations (including carousals) or hovers using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we made dynamic pages for displaying product description, Cart page and Wishlist page using JavaScript(DOM, local storage) . We made all the functions like sorting according to categories, search engine for searching products in the website, adding items to the Wishlist, adding items to the cart with quantity, and billing using discount coupon and shipment charges using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
